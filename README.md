## Assessed Exercise 2 - Networking

### Brief Description:
For this assessed exercise, the task was to create a simple, lightweight networking application using the sockets library. It is related around file storage, with the client having the ability to upload and download files to and from the server, which should be stored in the server_data directory. There is a client_data directory also, which is used by default, although there is a variable you can set in client.py if you wish to hardcode the path to this directory.
